Python Lists
In Python, a list is a collection of items, which can be of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning that you can change their content (add, modify, or remove items) after they are created. Lists are defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items inside square brackets [ ].
